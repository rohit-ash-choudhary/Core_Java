/*
It is a special form of Association where:

It represents Has-A&rsquo;s relationship.
It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example,
a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending
one entity will not affect the other entity.
