        1. Throwable is parent class of Exception class
        2. Throwable inherit two class Exception & Error

Exception Vs Error :
 1. Exception is occurred by our program Vs Error occur becoz of Lack of resources like less ram
 2. Exception is recovery by programmer but programmer not able to recover error
 3. Exception is Two Times Compile Time(Checked ) & Unchecked (RunTime) Exception where Error is only
    Runtime exception
